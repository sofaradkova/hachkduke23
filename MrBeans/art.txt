The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, 
is the form that the federal government, states, colleges 
and other organizations use to award financial aid. Submitting 
it is your key to accessing grants, scholarships, work-study
 programs and federal student loans.
Completing the FAFSA is the first step for anyone making 
college plans. But you should also know what other options
 are available and how much you can afford to borrow.
 Everything starts with the FAFSA. Submit the FAFSA each 
 year you’re in college — it only takes 30 minutes on average
  to complete when you’re prepared. And heads up: the redesigned
   FAFSA is expected to launch in December 2023 for the 2024-25 
   academic year — a delay from the typical Oct. 1 release date. 
   You can still submit the 2023-24 FAFSA until June 30, 2024.
    Stay tuned for more updates on the new FAFSA deadline.
